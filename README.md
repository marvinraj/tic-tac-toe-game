# Computer Versus Human Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python. It was developed as part of the final project for the CSC1024 Programming Principles course at Sunway University.

## How it Works

The Computer Versus Human Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a 2-player game played on a 3x3 grid. One player represents the human and uses 'X', while the other, although not AI-driven, represents the computer and uses 'O'. The computer makes random moves. The objective is simple: achieve three of your symbols in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, to win the game.

## Features

- **Player vs. Computer:** Challenge yourself against a computer opponent that follows predefined rules and strategies for gameplay.

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Experience a user-friendly command-line interface that allows players to make their moves by specifying row and column numbers.

- **Win Detection:** The program accurately detects when a player has won or when the game ends in a draw.
